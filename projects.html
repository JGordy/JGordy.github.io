      <p>This project was a culmination of all the training I recieved in the Iron Yard front end courses. We used the Itunes API to build out a music search that would play 30 second samples when the song is clicked. I added a few extra touches in the slideshow and the transition to loading the search results. Click on the title above to see the finished product hosted on Github.</p>

      <p>The calculator was the first big project we had in our front end instruction. There were definitely challenges, but I'm very proud of the results. My favorite feature is the ablility to scroll through your history. Try out the working version on my Github by clicking on the title above. </p>

      <p>Our first weekend project at the Iron Yard, we were given a mockup that we had to match as close as possible. I feel like I nailed it! Even included a little parallax scrolling on the about page. Click the title above to check it out. </p>
